# Smart Office Assistant - Implementation Summary

## ðŸ”§ **Critical Issues Fixed**

### **Issue 1: Booking Display Bug - RESOLVED âœ…**

**Root Cause Identified:**
- `BookingManagementScreen.tsx` was calling `userAPI.getUserParkingReservations(user.id)` 
- This function **did not exist** in the API, causing parking reservations to fail loading
- Users could create bookings but couldn't see them in the "Manage Bookings" page

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added missing `getUserParkingReservations` function to `userAPI` in `lib/supabase-api.ts`
- Function includes proper joins with parking spot details
- Implements pagination and proper error handling
- Follows existing API patterns for consistency

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Added to userAPI in lib/supabase-api.ts (lines 293-306)
async getUserParkingReservations(userId: string, limit = 10): Promise<ParkingReservation[]> {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('parking_reservations')
    .select(`
      *,
      parking_spots:parking_spot_id (spot_number, spot_type, section, floor)
    `)
    .eq('user_id', userId)
    .order('reservation_date', { ascending: false })
    .limit(limit);

  if (error) throw error;
  return data;
}
```

**Impact:**
- âœ… Parking reservations now display correctly in booking management
- âœ… Room bookings continue to work as expected
- âœ… Proper error handling and data validation in place
- âœ… Consistent API patterns maintained
